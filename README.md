Focuses: Thread Syncronization & Shared Resouce protextion

This program simulates a simple banking application with a focus on threads sharing access to 
certain resources. It can perform all the usual banking app functions such as depositing, 
withdrawals, and transfers. With functionality like deadlock detection and mutex locks, this 
program serves as a proof of concept for something to be made on a larger scale
